# Graphs
A non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of `vertices` (or `nodes`) potentially connected
by line segments named `edges`.

## Challenge
This is a new data structure implementation

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API
* `add_node`:
* `add_edge`:
* `get_nodes`:
* `get_neighbors`:
* `size`:
