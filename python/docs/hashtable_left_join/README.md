# Hashmap LEFT JOIN
Write a function called left_join that takes in 2 hashmaps. The first hashmap has word strings as keys, and a
synonym of the key as values. The second hashmap also has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
Return a data structure that holds the result.
* Combine the key and corresponding values(if they exist) into a new data structure according to LEFT JOIN logic.
* If no values exist in the right hashmap, then some flavor of "NULL" should be used and appended to the result row.
